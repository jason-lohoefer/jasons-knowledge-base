# About This Knowledge Base

This site was created as part of **Project 02: Final Knowledge Base Publication**, showcasing my ability to design and publish a structured digital information system. It demonstrates how thoughtful organization, clear navigation, and consistent formatting can turn a large body of information into a useful resource for travelers.  

## Purpose
The goal of this knowledge base is to provide travelers with reliable, easy-to-navigate guidance. It blends practical tips, cultural insights, and safety advice into a single system, showing how abstract principles of information organization can be applied in a real-world context.

## Structure
The site is divided into six main categories:  
- **Destinations** — Highlights regions including the USA, Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Europe.  
- **Planning & Preparation** — Packing, budgeting, itineraries, and documents.  
- **Transportation** — Options for flights, trains, buses, cars, and local transit.  
- **Accommodation** — Hotels, hostels, unique stays, and booking strategies.  
- **Culture & Experiences** — Food, festivals, museums, and local traditions.  
- **Safety & Health** — Tips for staying safe, healthy, and prepared abroad.  

Each page contains YAML frontmatter for metadata, rich Markdown formatting for readability, and internal links that tie categories together.
