I’m Jason Lohoefer, currently an IT Implementation Specialist with a passion for problem-solving and creating smarter, more efficient systems. Outside of work, I love traveling and exploring different cultures, discovering new foods, and finding unique experiences along the way. When I’m not immersed in tech or on the road, you’ll usually find me watching football or basketball, tending to my plants, or relaxing with a good movie or show. My church community is also a meaningful part of my life, giving me a strong sense of connection, support, and purpose.
