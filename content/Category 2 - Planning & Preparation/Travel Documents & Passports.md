# Travel Documents & Passports
Having the correct documents is one of the most important parts of preparing for travel. Without them, you may face delays, denied entry, or extra stress at the airport.

Always check the [U.S. State Department](https://travel.state.gov) website for up-to-date passport and visa requirements.

## Essential Documents
- **Passport** – Ensure it’s valid for at least 6 months beyond your trip.  
- **Visas** – Check if your destination requires a visa in advance.  
- **ID** – A government-issued ID may be required for domestic travel.  
- **Tickets** – Keep both physical and digital copies of flights, trains, or buses.  
- **Insurance card** – Carry proof of health or travel insurance.  

## Tips
- Make photocopies of your passport and keep them separate from the original.  
- Store digital scans in a secure cloud service.  
- Use a travel wallet or organizer to keep everything in one place.  
- Research entry requirements for every country on your itinerary.
