# Air Travel Tips
Air travel is the fastest way to reach faraway destinations, but it comes with its own challenges. Planning ahead ensures a smoother flight experience.

## Booking & Preparation
- Compare fares using multiple search engines. (Google Flights has a handy price tracker, for instance.)
- Choose flights with longer layovers if you’re worried about delays.  
- Check baggage policies to avoid extra fees.  

## At the Airport
- Arrive a couple hours early depending on your destination.  
- Keep essentials (passport, tickets, medications) in your carry-on.  
- Download your airline’s app for the easiest updates.  

## In Flight
- Stay hydrated by drinking water.  
- Stretch and walk to reduce stiffness.  
- Bring noise-canceling headphones for comfort.
